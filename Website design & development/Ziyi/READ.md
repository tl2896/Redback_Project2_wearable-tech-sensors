Project goal:  My personal task was to complete 4 web pages for Redback Operation project 2 "Wearable Technologies and Sensors" as well as to convert two of them. As we are a project aimed at older people, I have designed all my web pages in line with simplicity. I hope that through my designs I can help older people.

File Inventory: My folder is named Ziyi, and underneath Ziyi I have two files for my pages, login and signup, which I later combined into one file because I needed the link to the page. It contains the html, css and js files for both pages, as well as the required web images.

File Interrelations: Each HTML is what provides the text for the page, the CSS files are used to decorate the web design, including visual effects such as colours, and the JS files are where I implement the interactive elements. Of these I have linked two of the pages I have designed, but as all the planned pages for the website team have not yet been finalised, plans will also be made to link each page next term.

Project Status: As of 13 December 2023, I have converted both pages via Vs.code. In the subsequent progress we will work with the mobile application team to build firebase for the users. in the overall design we meet consistency, including consistency with the previous project design, and simplicity.

All code is backed up, so if you run into any problems, please feel free to contact me.
