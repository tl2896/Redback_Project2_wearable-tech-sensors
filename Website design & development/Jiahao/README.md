<h>Readme file for Jiahao's Work</h>

<b>Project Goal</b>: my personal project goal is to complete 4 website pages for Redback Operation, Project 2 "Wearable Tech & Sensors".
These 4 pages are homepages for wearable tech & the built-in sensor, as well as the product information on these two product. 
I aim to deliver a user-friendly website design, with interactive elements, and a user-centered concept for my website. 
The purpose of these pages are straight-forward to promote visibilities of the Redback's products, and attract more potential users. 
For providing a more friendly environment, since our targetted users are more likely to be elders, I have also implemented pop-up chat box for providing external assistance,
for the users who may not have enough experience of the digital literacy. 

<b>File Inventory</b>: Within my folder under "Jiahao" name, there are four seperated folders, each contains a single page of the website that I have converted into interactive functional website. 
Each folder are renamed as their purpose, example "Wearable_Tech_Home_Info", each one of these folders contains their individual HTML, CSS, and JS files to keep the website functional, as well as multiple images that have been linked with the webpages. 

<b>File Interrelations</b>: Each HTML files takes the role for provide context of the website, and the CSS files makes the webpage more colorful and better looking, and JS files is where I implement interactive elements. Due to the situation where all planned pages within website team has not been finalised, so linking up each page will be planned into next trimester as well. 

<b>Project Status</b>:Until 13/12/2023, I have completed 4 pages of the inital webpage design, and have converted these 4 pages into functional website page as we previous planned. There are left overs planned for the next coming trimesters, which includes collaboration with the mobile application team within the same project, we have agreed on implementing a single login method for both platforms, via a third party tools called "firebase". We have also discussed and decided on using "Fire store" as our data synchorisation provider to keep track of the user's data. The mobile application team has decided to follow our UI design to keep the overall design consistency, which we followed from the previous handover and Redback's main page. I have personally added a feature called "pop-up chatbox" for extra assistance within the website, which is recommended to keep onto the upcoming work in next trimester.
