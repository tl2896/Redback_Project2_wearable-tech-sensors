The Wearable Tech Sensors project, under the umbrella of Redback Operations, aimed to develop a predictive model for athlete injury prevention based on sleep data and vital signs. This initiative was part of a broader effort to harness advanced data analytics in sports science, particularly targeting the health and performance of athletes. 

For this project the code files follow an order (Directory Information) - 

1) Pre-Analysis on the dataset - (Pre-Analysis SleepData) 

2) Model development and Execution - SleepModelTesting.ipynb or  SleepModelTesting.py both files could be used, both contains same code just suitable for individual choice to use original python environment code or google collaboration notebook .ipynb. 

3)Testing of Model on restricted sleep data - (SleepModelTesting) contains code for it.
