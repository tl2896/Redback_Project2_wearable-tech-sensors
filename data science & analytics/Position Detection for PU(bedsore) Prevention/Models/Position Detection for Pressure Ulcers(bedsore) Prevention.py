# <b>F1-score:</b> The harmonic mean of precision and recall is high, indicating a good<br> balance between precision and recall.<br>
# <b>Support:</b> The number of actual occurrences of each class in the test set.
# 
# <b>Individual Class Performance</b><br>
# Class 0, 1, 2, and 3: Perfect precision, recall, and F1-score.<br>
# Class 4: Slightly lower precision, indicating a few false positives.<br>
# Class 5: Lower recall and F1-score, suggesting that the model struggles more<br> with this class.<br>
#

# ### GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters

# This code essentially performs hyperparameter tuning for an SVM model<br>using a grid search approach and evaluates the final model on a test dataset.
# 
# <b>Standard scaling</b> is applied to the features using StandardScaler to ensure<br>that all features have the same scale.
# 
# <b>param_grid</b> is a dictionary containing lists of hyperparameter values to search over.<br>In this case, it includes different values for the regularization parameter C<br>and the kernel coefficient gamma.
# 
# <b>GridSearchCV</b> is used to perform a grid search with cross-validation<br> (6-fold cross-validation in this case) to find the best combination of hyperparameters<br> for the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel.

# ### TensorFlow neural network

# <b>Epoch Information</b>
# The training process is performed for 10 epochs.<br>
# Each epoch represents a complete pass through the entire training dataset.<br>
# For each epoch, training and validation metrics are provided, including loss and accuracy.
# 
# <b>The training history is visualised with two plots:</b>
# - <b>Model Accuracy</b>: Both training and validation accuracy increase over epochs,<br> indicating that the model is learning from the training data and generalizing<br> well to the validation set.
# - <b>Model Loss</b>: Both training and validation loss decrease, showing that the model<br> is improving in minimizing the sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function.
# 
# <b>Training Metrics (Epochs 1-10)</b>
# <b>Training Loss:</b> The training loss decreases from 1.9950<br> in the first epoch to 0.3708 in the tenth epoch. A decreasing loss indicates that the model<br> is improving in fitting the training data.
# 
# <b>Accuracy:</b> The training accuracy increases from 14.00% in the first epoch to 92.70% in the<br> tenth epoch. This shows the percentage of correctly classified samples in the training data.
# 
# <b>Validation Metrics (Epochs 1-10)</b>
# <b>Val_loss (Validation Loss):</b> The loss on the validation<br> set decreases from 1.6421 in the first epoch to 0.3463 in the tenth epoch. Similar to training loss,<br> decreasing validation loss is a positive sign.
# 
# <b>Val_accuracy (Validation Accuracy):</b> The accuracy on the validation<br> set increases from 34.96% in the first epoch to 93.11% in the tenth epoch.<br> This reflects the model's performance on data it has not seen during training.
# 
# <b>Test Metrics (After Training)</b>
# 
# <b>Test Accuracy:</b> The final accuracy on the test set is reported as 93.34%.<br> This metric provides an assessment of the model's generalization performance on unseen data.

# The overall architecture of the neural network includes an input layer with the specified number<br> of features, and the model is initialized with this input layer. Additional layers, such as hidden<br> layers and output layers, would typically be added to the model to complete its architecture.<br> This is clearly shown in line code 20-37.
# 
# 
# The overall purpose of line code 42-50 seems to be dynamically adding hidden layers to a neural<br> network until the number of hidden units (hidden_units) becomes less than or equal to the specified<br> number of output units (output_units). The decrement of hidden units by 5 in each iteration suggests<br> a gradual reduction in the complexity of the neural network during training.
# 
# It is worth noting that the specific context of how this code fits into the larger program or what the neural<br> network is intended for is not provided. The effectiveness and appropriateness of this approach depend<br> on the specific requirements and characteristics of the problem being addressed.
# 
# optimizer: This parameter specifies the optimization algorithm to be used during training.<br> In this case, 'adam' is used. Adam (short for Adaptive Moment Estimation) is a popular optimization<br> algorithm that adjusts the learning rates of each parameter individually, providing a good balance between<br> efficiency and effectiveness. Other optimizers include 'sgd' (Stochastic Gradient Descent),<br> 'rmsprop' (Root Mean Square Propagation), etc.
# 
# loss: This parameter defines the loss function that the model will use during training. The loss function<br> measures how well the model performs on the training data. 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy' is a specific<br> loss function suitable for classification problems where the labels are integers (like 0, 1, 2, etc.). If your labels<br> were one-hot encoded (binary vectors indicating the class), you would use 'categorical_crossentropy'.
# 
# metrics: This parameter specifies the evaluation metric(s) that the model should use during training and testing.<br> In this case, 'accuracy' is chosen. During training, the model's performance will be monitored based on accuracy,<br> and the results will be displayed after each epoch. This is a common metric for classification problems,<br> measuring the proportion of correctly classified samples.
# 
# After compiling the model, it is ready for training using the fit method. The model will use the specified optimizer,<br> loss function, and metrics to adjust its weights and biases during the training process. The training process<br> involves forward and backward passes through the network, updating the parameters to minimize the chosen<br> loss function. Once trained, the model can be evaluated on new data, and predictions can be made.

# ### Confusion Matrix

# The confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of model predictions on the test set across different classes.<br> It is visualized using the ConfusionMatrixDisplay from scikit-learn. This is a normalized confusion matrix.<br> Each row corresponds to the true class, and each column corresponds to the predicted class.<br> The values in the matrix are normalized, meaning they represent the fraction of true instances for each class that<br> were correctly or incorrectly predicted.
# 
# This allows you to see how well the model is performing for each class, including any potential misclassifications.
# 
# Here is how to interpret the confusion matrix:
# - <b>Diagonal Elements (Top-left to Bottom-right):</b>
#   - The values on the diagonal (e.g., 0.97807018, 1.0, 1.0, 0.99494949, 1.0) represent the accuracy for<br>each class. These are the proportions of correctly classified instances for each class.
# - <b>Off-diagonal Elements:</b>
#   - The non-zero values off the diagonal (e.g., 0.02192982, 0.00505051, 0.03809524, 0.00952381) indicate<br> misclassifications between different classes. For example, in the first row, third column (0.02192982)<br> indicates the proportion of instances of class 1 that were misclassified as class 3.
#   
# <b>Interpretation of Specific Values</b>
# Example: The value 0.00505051 in the fourth row, first column suggests<br> that approximately 0.5% of instances of class 3 were misclassified as class 1.
# 
# <b>Class Imbalances</b>
# If the number of instances varies significantly between classes, misclassification rates might<br> not provide a complete picture. It could be helpful to consider precision, recall, or F1-score for a more<br> detailed assessment.
# 
# <b>Overall Performance</b>
# The diagonal values should be high, and off-diagonal values should be low for a<br> well-performing model.
