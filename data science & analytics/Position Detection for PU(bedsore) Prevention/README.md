Project README - Individual Contributions
Project Goals
The primary objective of my contributions to the Wearable Sensor project was to leverage data analysis tools and techniques for the development of a non-invasive system using wearable sensors and deep learning techniques. Specifically, I focused on the following goals:
1.	Model Development: Train a TensorFlow neural network model capable of predicting patient positions based on real-time sensor data from inertial sensors (accelerometer and magnetometer).
2.	Data Interpretation: Provide insightful visualizations and interpretations of the model's performance, including training metrics, validation metrics, and a confusion matrix.
3.	Documentation: Contribute to the creation of a comprehensive README to provide transparency regarding my individual contributions, the model's architecture, and the project's progress.
File Inventory
My contributions encompass the creation of several key files, each serving a distinct purpose:
1.	Position_Detection_Model.ipynb:
•	Purpose: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for the development and training of the TensorFlow neural network model. It includes sections for model architecture, epoch information, training history visualization, test set evaluation, and data interpretation.
2.	Confusion_Matrix_Visualization.ipynb:
•	Purpose: This Jupyter Notebook focuses specifically on the creation and interpretation of the confusion matrix, providing detailed insights into the model's performance on the test set.
3.	README.md:
•	Purpose: This README file serves as a comprehensive document detailing my individual contributions to the project. It includes information on project goals, file inventory, file interrelations, and project status.
File Interrelations
•	Position_Detection_Model.ipynb:
•	Interacts with the dataset to train the TensorFlow neural network model.
•	Produces visualizations and metrics that are referenced and interpreted in the README.md file.
•	Confusion_Matrix_Visualization.ipynb:
•	Utilizes the test set data to create a confusion matrix for detailed performance analysis.
•	The insights from this file contribute to the overall interpretation of the model's strengths and areas for improvement in the README.md file.
•	README.md:
•	References information from both Jupyter Notebooks to provide a cohesive overview of my individual contributions.
•	Provides a link to the GitHub repository for access to the complete project documentation.
Project Status
As of the current trimester, the model development and data interpretation tasks have been successfully completed. The Jupyter Notebooks, namely Position_Detection_Model.ipynb and Confusion_Matrix_Visualization.ipynb, capture the essence of these contributions.
To be continued in the next trimester:
•	Web Interface Development: The creation of a user-friendly web interface for medical staff to visualize patient information.
•	Integration of Machine Learning Model: Ongoing implementation of the machine learning model to enhance prediction accuracy.
•	Interactive Data Visualization: Planned implementation of interactive data visualization features within the web interface.
The README.md file will be periodically updated to reflect the project's progress and provide a roadmap for future tasks.
