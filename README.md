# README Documentation for Wearable Tech Sensors Project (T3-2023) - Redback Operation

## Project Overview
This README provides comprehensive details about the Wearable Tech Sensors project under Redback Operation for the trimester T3-2023. The project's primary aim was to develop wearable tech sensors for two distinct user groups: athletes and the elderly.

### Project Goals
- **For Athletes**: Develop a sensor-based injury prevention system to monitor hydration, fatigue, illness, sleep, recovery, cardiovascular health, and other injury risks. The goal is to optimize athletesâ€™ workload and enhance performance.
- **For the Elderly**: Create intuitive wearable devices for health monitoring, fall detection, bedsore prevention, and fostering social connectivity.

## GitHub Repository Structure
Our GitHub repository is organized into three main folders, each representing the different groups within our project:

1. **Mobile Application**: This folder contains all the developments for the Fitness Tracker Application, including source code and a dedicated README file detailing the code functionality and workings.

2. **Website Design & Development**: This folder hosts the web development team's efforts. It includes web page designs, source codes, and its own README file that elaborates on the website's design aspects and user interface details.

3. **Data Science & Analytics**: This folder is subdivided into the following subfolders, each with a separate README file describing the specific feature and its implementation:
   - Hydration
   - Disease Prediction for Elderly People
   - Injury Prediction by Sleep Data Analysis
   - Position Detection for PU (Bedsore) Prevention

Each README file within these folders provides in-depth insights into the respective projects, covering aspects such as project objectives, methodologies, technologies used, achievements, and future plans.

## Future Prospects
This project lays a strong foundation for future development and innovation in wearable technology, aiming to enhance the well-being and safety of athletes and elderly individuals. Continuous updates and advancements are anticipated in the upcoming trimester, with a focus on achieving greater impact and reach.
